When making an addition:
1. Insert the project in alphabetical order
2. Follow the following template (use ðŸ”¶ for Swift projects)
3. Avoid iOS or open-source in description as it is assumed :-)

- App name: Short description ðŸ”¶
  - source url, i.e. https://github.com/username/project
  - https://itunes.apple.com/app/app-name/id-zzz

or
